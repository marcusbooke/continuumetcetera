## Lessons from the Book

Too many to list and to be discovered in subsequent reads.
C.17 The Law of Generational Myopia

Seize the historical moment.

### Lesson 1

The rising tide.
C.18 The Law of Death Denial

Meditate on your mortality.Understanding the shortness of life fills us with sense of purpose and urgency to realize our goals. It gives us a sense of proportion, of what what really matters in this brief existence of ours. We must see the mortality in everyone, how it equalizes and connect us all. Become deeply aware of your mortality to intensify your experience of every aspect of your life.


### Lesson 2

The bullet in the side. The story of Mary Flannery O’Connor (1925-1964) whose father died very young and she died very young also. O’Connor was a remarkable fighter of life and an author.

We can accept that life involves pain and suffering, and we use such moments to strengthen ourselves to learn. and as with Flannery, the awareness of our mortality cleanses us of silly illusions and intensifies every aspect of our experience.


### Lesson 3

Paradoxical death effect: Our awareness of death has terrified us, shaped our beliefs, religions, institutions and so much of our behavior in ways to we cannot see or understand. One consequence of this is that we have become the slaves to our fears and our evasions. But we can cut loose from all the illusions and addictions that we employ to numb our anxiety.

Death is absolute stillness, without movement or change except decay. Life is movement, connection to other living things, and diversity of life forms. By connecting to the reality of death, we connect more profoundly to the reality and fullness of life. By separating death from life and repressing our awareness of it, we do the opposite, hence the concept of paradoxical death effect. Moments and encounters make us feel more awake and alive. We can create for ourselves the positive paradoxical effect.

### Lesson 4

Make the awareness of death visceral (deep inward feelings rather than to the intellect). Samurai’s ritual. Death has become an abstract notion and its effect has diminished. Meditate like a samurai to feel the death as reality that can come any moment and let that emotion revitalize your senses to live a fuller life.

> The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty. – Kenko 

Remember Dostoevsky’s death sentence tuning into hard labor in Siberia. The resulting affect was that of being reborn.


### Lesson 5

Awaken to the shortness of life. If a deadline is forced upon us on a particular project, that dreamlike relationship to time is shattered and for some mysterious reason we find focus to get done in days what would have taken weeks or months. (also see Parkinson’s Law: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion).


### Lesson 6

Embrace all pain and adversity. Nietzsche called amor fati (love of fate). What this means id the following: There’s much in life we cannot control, with death is ultimate example of this. We will experience illness and physical pain. We will go through separation with people. We will face failures from our mistakes and the nasty malevolence of our fellow humans. And our task is to accept these moments and even embrace them, nor for the pain but for the opportunities to learn and strengthen ourselves.


### Lesson 7

See the mortality in everyone. Daniel Defoe’s book A Journal of the Plague Year.

### Lesson 8

We must think of our mortality as a kind of “continual deadline”, giving a similar effect as described in this chapter to all actions in life. With this continual awareness we can see what really matters, how petty squabbles and side pursuits are irritating distractions.

Unique consciousness of death has created our particular form of love. And through a deepening of our awareness, we will only strengthen this impulse and rid ourselves of the divisions and lifeless separations that afflict humanity.

> Premeditation of death is premeditation of freedom. He who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave. – Michel de Montaigne
