## How to Take Smart Notes

Capture literature notes and fleeting notes during the day. Once a day (preferably at the same time each day), go through your literature notes and fleeting notes from the past 24 hours, and determine which notes you should convert to permanent notes. @ahrensHowTakeSmart2022 []


Ask yourself two questions when determining if you should make a note permanent:

1. Does this note produce a similar level of excitement as when I first captured it? I often have brilliant ideas in a caffeinated state at a coffee shop, but when I review my notes at home in a non‐caffeinated state, most of the ideas I captured are useless.
2. Does this note add value to other permanent notes? If an idea is not critical to your project or does not expand your understanding of a topic in your Zettelkasten system, do not waste time converting it to a permanent note).

Add three things to every permanent note:

1. A location code prefixed to the title

* Prefix the title of every permanent note with a location code to easily sort and reference your notes. The first note you add to your Zettelkasten system will have a “1” prefixed to its title, and your second note will have a “2” prefixed to its title. If your third note builds on the first note, place it between notes “1” and “2,” with the code “1A” prefixed to its title. If you have notes, “1A” and “1B,” and wish to insert a note between those two notes, it will have the code “1A1.” And if you insert a note between “1A1” and “1A2,” its code will be “1A1A.” Notice a pattern?
2. A list of keywords in the top right corner

*  Keywords are like Twitter hashtags in that they group notes together and are used to quickly find relevant notes. Aim to
add one to three keywords to the top right corner of every permanent note. Identify keywords by asking yourself: “What
is one word or phrase that will relate this note to an existing note?”
*  When you come up with a new keyword or phrase, put it on your “Master Index” located at the front of your index card
box. The Master Index includes keywords and phrases with location codes (like “3A1”) you can use when determining where you should insert new notes. Continuously update your “master index” with keywords and use your “master index” to outline your first draft.

3. Links to permanent notes in the bottom right corner

*  Often a permanent note will have many potential friends in your Zettelkasten system. For example, if a new note
could fit nicely behind note “12A1” and have the code “12A2,” but it also relates to notes “2B1” and “24B,” don't spend too much time debating where the note should go. Simply code the note “12A2” and write down location codes to related notes in the bottom right corner of the note so you can review these links when you write your first draft. Finding links to notes in other parts of your Zettelkasten system is a great way to expand your web of knowledge and spark new ideas that improve your book, school paper, or article.
